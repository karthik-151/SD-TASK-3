--> Description:

The Task Manager Application is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) program built in Java. It uses an ArrayList to store tasks dynamically in memory.

--> Each task is represented by a Task object that contains:

.id → unique identifier for each task

.title → short title of the task

.description → detailed explanation of the task

--> The program provides a menu-driven interface where users can:

.Create a new task

.View all tasks

.Update an existing task

.Delete a task

.Exit the program

This is a console application (runs in terminal/PowerShell/command prompt).
